\chapter{Introduction}
Agilefant is an open source tool for task and requirement management for agile software development. It is provided as an open-source version and a hosted version. The hosted version comprises more and better features in comparison to the open-source version.

Agilefant has approximately 10,000 users worldwide, and according to the customer, the number of registered users increases every day. 
 
Currently Agilefant can be used on a laptop / computer, but it is not responsible to be used on mobile devices. The customer wishes that the users of Agilefant could use its the most important functions using their mobile phones and tablets. The goal of our team is to develop a mobile application that works along the hosted version of Agilefant and can be used on smart phones.

NB! Each developer should act as an assistant to some of the SE experts in order to get a broader view to the project.

\chapter{The Goals}
\section{Project goals}

The main goal is to develop an mobile application for Agilefant that contains the main functionalities of its cloud version.

\end{table}


\section{Personal goals}

Personal learning goals can be found in Google Docs: \href{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ahu59q_GwtcedHJZdjQ1RWROZFYxa0RTcWp3MkJkTnc&usp=sharing}{Learning Goals}

\chapter{Resources}
\section{Personnel}

Each member must invest `credits \* 27 hours - 15 hours´ in the project.

\href{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ahu59q_GwtcedHI3MnJQM0NWZS11aGxFTzFZeVEyQVE&usp=sharing}{Link} to the time allocation page. Everyone should mark how much time he/she is going to use per a week to the table.

\section{Material}

Everyone should have a computer. We also need mobile phones to test the application. It could be possible to get desktop computers (or extra screens) if we get a own room.

A development environment can be downloaded from Internet if needed. Eclipse is an open-source and free to download, and the project manager has a JetBrain's Classroom License, so that IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate can be used during the course.

\chapter{Work practices}
\section{Practices}
\subsection{Iterative development}

Development will be divided into several sprints so that after every sprint we would have an improved version of the application ready to release.

A sprint contains four phases: sprint planning, development, demo, and retrospective. 

\subsection{Sprint planning}

Sprint planning session will be divided into two parts. The content of the sprint planning is presented in Table 3.

Stories will be estimated based on fibonacci numbers.
Story points will be given based on people’s opinion of how much time it requires to finish the story. Possible story points are listed below:
1: without a break
2: half a day
3: a day (= full work day for a pair)
5: two work days
10: five days

If the story is estimated to be larger than 10 story points, it can be seen as an epic and should be split to smaller stories so that it can be finished during the sprint.


\begin{table}[H]
\center
\begin{tabular}{|p{1cm}|p{2cm}|p{5cm}|p{4cm}|} 
	
\hline 
\textbf{Part} & \textbf{Duration} & \textbf{Description} & \textbf{Participants} \\ 
\hline
1 & 1h & The product owner presents the prioritized product backlog, so that the teams would understand what should be done during a following sprint. The product owner is there for answering any questions the teams would like to ask relating to the user stories and tasks. Then the teams select items from the product backlog to the sprint backlog based on their knowledge of how much work they are capable of doing during a sprint. Sprint goal is agreed in this part. & Product owner, team members \\
\hline
2 & 2h & Teams are separated to plan how the chosen work will be done during the sprint. Users stories will be assigned to team members. User stories are split into tasks and the required time per a task is estimated by a person the task was assigned to. In this meeting, the team can start design the system so that they are able to convert the backlog items into a working software increment. & Team members \\

\end{table}

\subsection{Documenting}

\subsection{Risk management}

\subsection{Time tracking}

Time tracking will be done using Agilefant. Everyone should log used hours directly to the story or task the person has been doing.


When the course is over, credits will be given based on the hours logged to the Agilefant (excluding lectures).

\subsection{Communication}

Team will keep a daily standup meeting every time they gather together to work. The daily standup will be a short, 15-minute time-boxed meeting where team members synchronize their activities. In this meeting, people will tell, in turn, three things: What they have done since last daily meeting, what they will do before the next meeting, and what obstacles are in the way.  

The product manager will propose if the team could use Flowdock as the main communication tool. Aalto provides 180 days license for that.

Google Hangout is proposed to be used for communication with off-site team members.

\subsection{Defect tracking}

Agilefant could be used

\subsection{Version control}

Git and Github will be used for version control. 

TODO: How to use it when 3 teams? Check options from \href{https://www.atlassian.com/git/workflows}{here}.

\subsection{Process improvement}

A retro will be arranged at the end of each sprint. There will be three phases:

\begin{enumerate}
\item First, we will go through impediments from the previous retro and check if the impediments has been fixed.
\item Second, each team member will write down aspects that has worked well and which might need some attention.
\item Third, these will be collected and written to Excel and everyone should explain what they wrote.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Requirement engineering}

Agilefant will be used for gathering requirements from customer and maintaining the backlog. 

\subsection{Design}

\subsection{Practice X}
